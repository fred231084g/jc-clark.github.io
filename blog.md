## Air head

my head is the air outside

pure smoke. earth scorched. 

tired like the planet saying fuck this 

I'mma burn you all and start over again


sinuses are a Tokyo crosswalk

thick with smoke-corpses

they make the sound of straining when they try to squeeze through

somehow, by some force of nature--or my inflamed ashy nose-holes--all that goo...

all those Tokyo-ites (corpsed out and ubiquitously whispy) need to squeeze through 

a pinhole 

my thin hole


when I sneeze (which is all the time), dust

bursts out and celebrates freedom



smoke is so thick we can't see the ground 

air is so torched our lungs are icy

eyes are so red even Justin Timberlake has to stop


## lord lardtongue

that. that right there.

when the ocean is like that. 

all gnarly and flapping

hissing between barnacles

it's sliding back into itself.

its tongue. flesh flapping

with gigantic hissing gulps

of itself

fuck. so big it is

so white at the tip of every 

flaptongue

KA-BOOM it slaps 

hulky wet and tight

like a turgid fat flap of

lord ocean's lardbelly 

god. DAMN it's real big


when it's like that

when THE OCEAN is like that:

consuming cliffs 

and children

with gorged flab flaps

gobbled little kids

slipping all over a uvula

and shrieking into 

lord's laughter

it's so fucking big while

it laps lardtongues 

back into istelf
