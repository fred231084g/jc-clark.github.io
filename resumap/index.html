        <h3>Hi ðŸ‘‹</h3>
        <p>My name is Joe Clark and you found my resumap. Welcome!<br><br>
            
            Resumes can only say so much and tend to feel kinda robotic to me.
            So I built this resumap to have some fun with code and give my resume more of a narrative.<br><br>
            
            As you scroll through the text, the map will fly you to the right location. 
            If you want to know a little bit more about who I am, sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight.<br><br>

        <h3>Seattle University</h3>
        <p>At SU, I wanted to study everything. Every class quenched a curious thirst and completely and drew me in. 
            Mechanical Engineering, Physics, Philosophy, English, Music, Sociologyâ€”you name it, I majored in it 
            or at least enrolled in every possible course.<br><br>
            
            At some point my advisor suggested slowing down and reevaluating (which made sense). 
            So I went for a dual degree in Liberal Studies and Physics because I always want a science nerd 
            quantum-tucked in my pocket for a rainy day...we all have our quarks.

        <h3>JOIN</h3>
        <p>After college, I joined AmeriCorps and volunteered for two years. 
            My first year was at <a href="https://joinpdx.org/">JOIN.</a><br><br>

            JOIN completely transformed what I knew about homelessness. Folks could come in
            for clean clothes, housing assistance, and showers. Many came to have a place to weather 
            the weather or access the internet or just exist for a bit. The bustling day space allowed 
            me to connect with people in a nonjudgmental zone and listen to stories of hardship, love, and loss.<br><br>
            
            As the Immersion Coordinator, I planned and led multi-day immersions to help groups 
            of students learn about homelessness in Portland and talk with people living on the streets. 
            I got to be a bridge builder and connect people who may not have connected otherwise. 
            The best part was facilitating huge transformations and witnessing perspectives shifting. 
            Nothing better than watching world-views get rocked.</p>

        <h3>Alaskan AIDS Assistance Association</h3>
        <p>My second AmeriCorps year brought me to Alaska.<br><br>
            
            At JOIN, I met a lot of people who were suffering from addiction. I needed to learn more about it. 
            So I chose to volunteer at the <a href="http://www.alaskanaids.org/">Alaskan AIDS Assistance Association</a> 
            and lead the Anchorage Syringe Exchange. People came to get clean needles 
            and dispose of dirty ones. Alongside the exchange, I managed a food pantry and 
            administered HIV and Hepatitis-C tests.<br><br>
            
            The tests included one-on-one risk assessments which were centered on colaboratively finding 
            plausible solutions to lower an individual's risk of self and community harm.
            For many, it was an incredible relief to open up to someone who didn't judge 
            them and didn't know their friends. For me, it was an opportunity to share space and 
            learn more about addiction, the complexities of addictions services in America, 
            and what people are experiencing day in and day out in our communities.</p>

        <h3>Big Brothers Big Sisters of Alaska</h3>
        <p>AmeriCorps was over, but I couldn't just leave Alaska. The Land of the Midnight Sun still called my name.
             I hopped on a plane and moved to Juneau.<br><br>
            
            In both of my AmeriCorps years, I kept meeting people who shared a similar storyâ€”
            somewhere along the line, broken or destructive relationships contributed to their hardships. 
            It's a harsh world out there and we need each other. 
            So I wanted to work in nonprofits centered on relationship-building. Working at 
            <a href="http://www.bbbsak.org/">Big Brothers Big Sisters</a> was my way of connecting with that issue.<br><br>
            
            I interviewed potential Bigs and Littles and matched them together based on commonalities and 
            personality. I then supported the pairs throughout the 
            life of their matches. It's wonderful to know I played a small part in so many wholesome friendships.

        <h3>Washington State School for the Blind</h3>
        <p>After a few years in Alaska, it was time to bid fare well. 
            I moved home and landed a gig at the <a href="https://www.wssb.wa.gov/wp/">Washington State School for the Blind</a>. 
            I was a residence life counselor and substitute teacher. After school each day, the students would 
            come back to their cottages where we would work on building life-skills to foster independence.<br><br>
            
            WSSB is a particularly wonderful place. It introduced me to a culture where blindness and visual 
            impairment are the status quo, and introduced me to incredibly inspiring people.</p>

        <h3>Appalachian Trail</h3>
        <p>Summer 2016: school was out and my partner was thru-hiking the AT. I had to join!<br><br>
            
            She thru-hiked 2,189.1 miles. The .1 matters. I managed to hobble out a measly 1,160-something. 
            We lived immersed in the sounds of the woods. We hiked 10 miles by lunch, 10 more after. 
            One day, we walked 30 miles. Another we hiked 19, clambered up 6 mountain peaks,
            and still made it to camp before sunset. We reverse calorie-counted and ate enough food to feed 
            several humans for several years. We embraced beautiful people into our "tramily" and didn't even know their real names.<br><br>
            
            My trail name was Frog King.</p>

<section id='mapbox'>
        <h3>Mapbox</h3>
        <p>I returned home after hiking the AT and having three months of quiet discernment in the woods. It was a perfect
            time for a change of direction. Among so many things, the AT taught me to celebrate the unknown and say "yes" to 
            unexpected pathways. So I applied for work at Mapbox. 
            I had never coded, or set up a repository in GitHub, and hadn't touched HTML since I customized my 
            Myspace page forever ago. But I'm happiest when I'm learning new things and every company needs 
            people to help troubleshoot and translate. Bridging communication gaps and meeting people 
            where they are both employ my strongest skillsets. I knew I'd be able to put those skills to good use on the 
            Support team at Mapbox.<br><br>
            
            Now I get to spend my days collaborating with customers and teammates. I advocate for our people and get to know 
            where problems come from to help build answers before the questions happen. 
            I think of each support ticket like a little interview, investigation, and opportunity for growth.
            If we make time to learn where we each are, where we came from, and what strengths and goals we bring to the table, 
            then we can share a common language and work together on something beautiful.<br><br>
