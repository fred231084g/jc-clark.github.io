        <h3>Hey, there!</h3>
        <p>My name is Joe Clark and you found my resumap. Welcome!<br><br>
            
            Resumes can only say so much and tend to feel robotic.
            I built this resumap to have some fun with code and give muy resume more of a narrative.<br><br>
            
            As you scroll through the text, the map will fly you to the right location. 
            So if you want to know a little bit more about who I am, sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight.<br><br>

        <h3>Seattle University</h3>
        <p>At SU, I flew through majors. 
            Mechanical Engineering, Physics, Philosophy, English, Sociologyâ€”you name it, I majored in it. 
            I had never experienced school like that, with a palpable atmosphere of curiosity and growth.<br><br>
            
            At some point my advisor suggested taking a step back (which made sense). 
            So I went for a dual degree in Liberal Studies and Physics because I always want a science nerd 
            quantum-tucked in my pocket for a rainy day...we all have our quarks.

        <h3>JOIN</h3>
        <p>After college, I joined AmeriCorps and volunteered for two years. 
            My first year was at <a href="https://joinpdx.org/">JOIN.</a><br><br>

            JOIN completely transformed what I knew about homelessness. Folks could come in
            and get clean clothes, housing assistance, and showers. Many came to have a place to weather 
            the weather or access the internet or just exist for a bit. The bustling day space allowed 
            me to connect with people in a nonjudgmental zone and listen to stories of hardship, love, and loss.<br><br>
            
            As the Immersion Coordinator, I planned and led multi-day immersions to help groups 
            of students learn about homelessness in Portland and talk with people living on the streets. 
            I got to be a bridge builder and connect of people who may not have connected otherwise. 
            The best part was facilitating huge transformations and witnessing perspectives shifting. 
            Nothing better than watching world-views get rocked.</p>

        <h3>Alaskan AIDS Assistance Association</h3>
        <p>My second AmeriCorps year brought me to Alaska.<br><br>
            
            At JOIN, I met a lot of people who were suffering from addiction. I yearned to learn more about it. 
            So I chose to volunteer at the <a href="http://www.alaskanaids.org/">Alaskan AIDS Assistance Association</a> 
            and lead the Anchorage Syringe Exchange. People came to get clean needles 
            and dispose of dirty ones. Alongside the exchange, I managed a food pantry and 
            administered HIV and Hepatitis-C tests.<br><br>
            
            The tests included one-on-one risk assessments which were centered on finding 
            plausible solutions to lower an individual's risk of self and community harm.
            For many, it was an incredible relief to open up to someone who didn't judge 
            them and didn't know their friends. For me, it was an opportunity share space and stories and 
            learn more about addiction, the complexities of addictions services in America, 
            and what people are experiencing day in and day out in our communities.</p>

        <h3>Big Brothers Big Sisters of Alaska</h3>
        <p>AmeriCorps was over, but I couldn't just leave Alaska. The Land of the Midnight Sun still called my name. 
            So, I hopped on a plane and moved to Juneau.<br><br>
            
            There are infinite factors that contribute to a person's adversity every story is unique. 
            But one commonality rang true among nearly every person I met during my AmeriCorps years. 
            Somewhere along the line, broken relationships contributed to their hardships. 
            So I wanted to work in nonprofits centered on relationship-building.
            <a href="http://www.bbbsak.org/">Big Brothers Big Sisters</a> was my way of connecting with that issue.<br><br>
            
            I interviewed potential Bigs and Littles and matched them together based on commonalities and 
            personality...I was a professional friend matcher. I then supported the pairs throughout the 
            life of their matches. It's wonderful to be able to say I had a part in so many wholesome friendships. 
            And I got paid to do it? In the most beautiful place ever? Swoon.

        <h3>Washington State School for the Blind</h3>
        <p>After a few years in Alaska, it was time to bid fare well. 
            I moved home and landed a gig at the <a href="https://www.wssb.wa.gov/wp/">Washington State School for the Blind</a>. 
            I was a substitute teacher, and residence life counselor. After school each day, the students would 
            come back to their cottages where we would work on building life-skills to foster independence.<br><br>
            
            WSSB is a particularly wonderful place. It introduced me to a culture where blindness and visual 
            impairment are the status quo, and introduced me to so many inspiring and incredible people.</p>

        <h3>Appalachian Trail</h3>
        <p>Summer 2016: school was out, the sun was shining, and my girlfriend was walking from 
            Georgia to Maine.  Heck yes, I had to join!<br><br>
            
            She thru-hiked 2,189.1 miles. The .1 matters. I managed to hobble out a measly 1,160-something. 
            We lived immersed in the sounds of the woods. We would walk 10 miles by lunch time. 10 more after. 
            One day, we walked 30 miles. Another we hiked 19, bagged 6 mountain peaks, ran the last 7.5 miles, 
            and still made it to camp before sunset. I'm only kind of exagerating. We ate enough food to feed 
            single a human being for several years. We embraced beautiful people into our "tramily."<br><br>
            
            My trail name was Frog King.</p>

        <h3>Mapbox</h3>
        <p>Insatiable curiosity and excitement about the possibilities for GIS led me to apply at Mapbox. 
            I had never coded, or set up a repository in GitHub, and hadn't touched HTML since I customized my 
            Myspace page forever ago. But I knew two things to be true: 1) I'm happiest when I'm learning new things and 
            2) every company needs people to help troubleshoot and translate. Bridging communication gaps and meeting people 
            where they are both employ my strongest skillsets. I knew I'd be able to put those skills to good use on the Support team at Mapbox.<br><br>
            
            Mapbox's incredible <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/">documentation</a> and 
            <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/">tutorials</a> 
            helped me jump right in and build this resumap.<br><br>
            
            Now I get to spend my days helping people understand blockers and solutions 
            for technical issues. I advocate for our customers and help build answers
            before people even have questions. 

            Every day is another adventure and I feel pretty lucky to work with amazing 
            people on an really cool thing. ðŸš€ ðŸ—º </p>

        <h3>See ya!</h3>
        <p>Thanks for reading my resumap. I hope it helped show a little more of my story and what makes me me.</p></p>
