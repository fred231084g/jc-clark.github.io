Thanks for stopping by. I'm a brother, uncle, photographer, musician, and serial hobbyist. Check out my projects on the sidebar if you feel so inclined. This website is a work in progress but I wouldn't want to host it any other way.

Whatever you do, I hope you have a lovely day and find space to take care of yourself and others.
